        <h1>Welcome to my datastructures tutorial in writing Javascript algorithms</h1>
        <h3>This page will mostly display results and the algorithm associated
            <br/>with such. The problems and notes about the algorithms are writen in
            <br/> mostly in the js file
        </h3>
        <div>First we are just making sure our script is being red</dic>
            <h2 id="test-1">a=1, b=4;<br/>
                a+b =
            </h2>
            <h3>GREEDY ALGORITHM EXAMPLE</h3>
            <div>Before posting the greedy algorithm I will just test
            <br/>if I even remember how to pass arrays to a function. sorry but it has been a minute
                <br/>
                var ar1 = [1,2,5,10]; is instantiated and the array INVOKES the REDUCE function using the dummy function
                <br/>rather than using the spread operator to try to feed the array. This might not work for the actual greedy algo
                <div>
                <div>reduce adds all the elements of our array :
                    <br/>[1 + 2 + 5 + 10];</div>
                <h2>hmm...</h2>
                <div>okay so it looks like reduce is a perfect method for our greedy algorithm if we 
                    <br/>simply use Math.max()
                </div>
                <h2 id="test-2">Here is our answer provided by the test algorithms script: </h2>    
                <small>okay actual greedy alg</small>
            <h2 id="algorithm-1">Here is the result of the actual greedyFunction: </h2>
